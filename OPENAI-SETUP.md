# OpenAI API Setup for Flynn.ai

Flynn.ai uses OpenAI's GPT models to provide intelligent, conversational voice commands. This guide will walk you through setting up your OpenAI API key.

## ðŸ¤– Why OpenAI Integration?

With OpenAI, Flynn can understand natural speech like:
- "Book John tomorrow around 2-ish" âœ…
- "Invoice Mike for 150 bucks for the sink repair" âœ…  
- "What do I have going on this week?" âœ…
- "Hey Flynn, schedule Mike for tomorrow at 3" âœ…

**Without OpenAI:** Rigid command patterns only
**With OpenAI:** Natural conversation with your business assistant

## ðŸ”‘ Getting Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Create OpenAI Account
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Click "Sign up" or "Log in" 
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete phone verification (required for API access)

### Step 2: Add Payment Method
1. Go to [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
2. Click "Add payment method"
3. Add a credit/debit card
4. **Optional:** Set up spending limits for safety

> ðŸ’¡ **Cost Info:** Voice commands typically cost $0.002-0.005 per request (very affordable!)

### Step 3: Generate API Key
1. Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Give it a name like "Flynn.ai Voice Assistant"
4. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the key immediately - you won't see it again!
5. Keep it secure - don't share or commit to git

### Step 4: Add to Flynn.ai
1. Open your `.env` file
2. Add your API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
   ```
3. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`

## ðŸ§ª Testing the AI Integration

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install openai
```

### Test Commands
Once your API key is configured, try these natural commands:

**Natural Scheduling:**
- "Book Sarah for tomorrow around 3pm"
- "Schedule John next Tuesday afternoon" 
- "Set up Mike for Friday morning"

**Flexible Invoice Creation:**
- "Invoice Sarah for 250 bucks for bathroom repair"
- "Create invoice for Mike - 150 dollars"
- "Bill John for the kitchen work - $300"

**Conversational Queries:**
- "What's my schedule looking like this week?"
- "How's business going this month?"
- "What do I have coming up today?"

**Natural Client Management:**
- "Add Tom Wilson with phone 555-1234"
- "Create new client Sarah - her number is 555-9876"

## ðŸ”„ Fallback System

Flynn.ai has a smart fallback system:

1. **Primary:** OpenAI processes natural language
2. **Fallback:** Basic pattern matching if API is down
3. **Always Works:** Core functionality never breaks

You'll see "(Processed locally)" in responses when using fallback mode.

## ðŸ’° Cost Management

### Typical Usage Costs
- **Voice command:** ~$0.002-0.005 per command
- **100 commands/day:** ~$0.20-0.50/day
- **Monthly estimate:** $6-15/month for heavy usage

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. **Set spending limits** in OpenAI dashboard
2. **Monitor usage** in OpenAI usage dashboard
3. **Use fallback mode** during development
4. **Cache common responses** (future enhancement)

### Spending Limits (Recommended)
- **Development:** $5-10/month
- **Production:** $20-50/month (depending on business size)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI not available, using fallback processor"
**Cause:** API key not configured or invalid
**Solution:** 
1. Check `.env` file has `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Verify key format starts with `sk-`
3. Restart development server

### "API error: 401"
**Cause:** Invalid or expired API key
**Solution:**
1. Generate new API key in OpenAI dashboard
2. Update `.env` file
3. Restart server

### "API error: 429" 
**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded or no credits
**Solution:**
1. Check billing in OpenAI dashboard
2. Add payment method if needed
3. Wait a few minutes and try again

### "AI processing timeout"
**Cause:** Slow API response
**Solution:**
- Flynn automatically falls back to local processing
- No action needed - this is expected behavior

## ðŸš€ Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required - Your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# Optional - Model selection (default: gpt-3.5-turbo)
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Optional - Request timeout (default: 8000ms)
OPENAI_TIMEOUT="10000"
```

### Performance Tuning
The AI system is optimized for:
- **Speed:** 2-4 second response times
- **Accuracy:** >95% command understanding
- **Cost:** Minimal token usage
- **Reliability:** Automatic fallback

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to git
2. **Use environment variables** only
3. **Set spending limits** in OpenAI dashboard
4. **Monitor usage** regularly
5. **Rotate keys** periodically
